Added **experimental** support for ``pyproject.toml`` configuration
(as introduced by :pep:`621`). Configuration parameters not covered by
standards are handled in the ``[tool.setuptools]`` sub-table.

In the future, existing ``setup.cfg`` configuration
may be automatically converted into the ``pyproject.toml`` equivalent before taking effect
(as proposed in :issue:`1688`). Meanwhile users can use automated tools like
:pypi:`ini2toml` to help in the transition.

Please note that the legacy backend is not guaranteed to work with
``pyproject.toml`` configuration.
