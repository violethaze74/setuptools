Deprecated ``setuptools.config.read_configuration``,
``setuptools.config.parse_configuration`` and other functions or classes
from ``setuptools.config``.

Users that still need to parse and process configuration from ``setup.cfg`` can
import a direct replacement from ``setuptools.config.setupcfg``, however this
module is transitional and might be removed in the future
(the ``setup.cfg`` configuration format itself is likely to be deprecated in the future).
